== How-To 

1. The download links for the respective curriculum should be included into the `docs/index.adoc` file.
2. Run the `gradle` build without parameters, it will generate an `index.html` 
3. The build will copy the generated html to the root of this repository, replacing the esisting `index.html`.
4. `git commit -m "<useful message>"` 
5. `git push`

easy, isn't it?
